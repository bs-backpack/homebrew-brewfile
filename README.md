# Brian's Brewfile

Below are instructions for things that can't be automated.

## Google Cloud SDK

`gcloud init`
`gcloud auth application-default login`
The latter may only work for Google Cloud account admins. Brian can provide a
service account JSON to enable login. (todo: document this)

## iTerm

Have to manually download and install solarized (color scheme). I'm using
Solarized Dark - Patched (easy to find if you Google it).
